Turning beehive formation dynamics into high-res tectonics

This thesis research investigates the architectural and tectonic potential that can
stem from behavioral complexity of collective construction in biological systems
and its dynamic relations with the colony in terms of the continuous construction
and adaptation process over the time. The role model considered as a case study
regards the dynamics of honeycomb formation, and in particular three
fundamental behaviours have been extracted from this biological process:
stigmergic behavior, structural self-stabilization capacity and environmental
adaptability. All these features were then coded into a multi agent system
interacting in an heterogeneous environment and capable of selectively adding
elements to a particle-spring system that is periodically self-adjusting, simulating
material behavior. The outcomes, strongly rich and heterogeneous in their spatial
organization, are characterized by a continuous tectonic of emerging
singularities seamlessly flowing into one another
